# Modern method to rue Python code on Node-RED
Python is a common programing language for data analysis and AI applications.
When Node-RED users create these applications, they need to consider how to integrate Node-RED flow with Python program.

## Conventional methods
The followings are general methods to call Python code from Node-RED.

- REST API and http request node
After creating REST API to provide servic built Python Flask frame work, http request node in Node-RED can call the REST API. This example is Model Asset eXchange container. It provides AI services by container. Node-RED users can call the REST API through the http request node.

- exec node
Another method is the exec node to execute Python command directly.
Before the execution of the command, user need to prepare the Python program in the local file system. This may be difficult to store 

## New method using Pyodide

## Node-RED flow

### template node

### function node
